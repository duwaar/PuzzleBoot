# An x86 Assembler Project

I'm working on this project in Ubuntu 18, with `VirtualBox` and `yasm`. If you want to run it, do the following:
- Clone this repo, start VirtualBox, and click "create a new machine".
- Name the machine, and choose "Other" and "Other/Unknown" for the OS and OS type, respectively.
- VirtualBox will suggest that you allot 64 MB of memory. That should be plenty.
- Instead of creating a new virtual drive, choose "Use an existing virtual hard disk file" and select `EmptyBoot.vdi`.
- Click "Create" to create the VM.
- To run the VM, select it and click "Run" at the top of the window.
